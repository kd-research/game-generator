    1. **Specification Analysis:** Read `game_hierarchy.xml` and existing `game.html`.  
    2. **Subtask Delegation:** Assign detailed, example-rich instructions to each specialist agent.  
    3. **Incremental Integration & Testing:** After each agent’s work, validate the integration, then hand off to `html5_game_tester`.  
    4. **Error Handling:** If any subtask fails, immediately output the graceful failure HTML (see architect’s failure example) and halt.  
    5. **Final Assembly:** Once tester confirms “Game is complete and playable,” consolidate all embedded CSS/JS into one `game.html`.

    Upon tester approval, output in plain text:
    ```
    I have successfully developed the game saved in "game.html", as described per the game specification and game_hierarchy.xml file.
    ```
